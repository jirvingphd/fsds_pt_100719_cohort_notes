    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lesson, we derived the functions that we help us descend along our cost functions efficiently.  Remember that this technique is not so different from what we saw with using the derivative to tell us our next step size and direction in two dimensions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/slopes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When descending along our cost curve in two dimensions, we used the slope of the tangent line at each point, to tell us how large of a step to take next.  And with the cost curve being a function of $m$ and $b$, we had to use the gradient to determine each step.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/new_gradientdescent.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "But really it's an analogous approach.  Just like we can calculate the use derivative of a function $f(x)$ to calculate the slope at a given value of $x$ on the graph and thus our next step.  Here, we calculated the partial derivative with respect to both variables, our slope and y-intercept, to calculate the amount to move next in either direction and thus to steer us towards our minimum.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Create functions to perform a simulation of gradient descent for an actual dataset\n",
    "* Represent RSS as a multivariable function and take partial derivatives to perform gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reviewing our gradient descent formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for us, we already did the hard work of deriving these formulas.  Now we get to see the fruit of our labor.  The following formulas tell us how to update regression variables of $m$ and $b$ to approach a \"best fit\" line.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- $ \\frac{dJ}{dm}J(m,b) = -2\\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i(y_i - (mx_i + b)) = -2\\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i*\\epsilon_i$ \n",
    "- $ \\frac{dJ}{db}J(m,b) = -2\\sum_{i = 1}^n(y_i - (mx_i + b)) = -2\\sum_{i = 1}^n \\epsilon_i $\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the formulas above tell us to take some dataset, with values of $x$ and $y$, and then given a regression formula with values $m$ and $b$, iterate through our dataset, and use the formulas to calculate an update to $m$ and $b$.  So ultimately, to descend along the cost function, we will use the calculations:\n",

    "\n",
    "The code above represents **just one** update to our regression line, and therefore just one step towards our best fit line.  We'll just repeat the process to take multiple steps.  But first, we have to make a couple of other changes. \n",

    "## Tweaking our approach \n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, the above code is very close to what we want, but we just need to make tweaks to our code before it's perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one is obvious if we think about what these formulas are really telling us to do.  Look at the graph below, and think about what it means to change each of our $m$ and $b$ variables by at least the sum of all of the errors, of the $y$ values that our regression line predicts and our actual data.  That would be an enormous change.  To ensure that we drastically updating our regression line with each step, we multiply each of these partial derivatives by a learning rate.  As we have seen before, the learning rate is just a small number, like $.\n",
    "01$ which controls how large our updates to the regression line will be.  The learning rate is  represented by the Greek letter eta, $\\eta$, or alpha $\\alpha$.  We'll use eta, so $\\eta = .01$ means the learning rate is $.01$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying our step size by our learning rate works fine, so long as we multiply both of the partial derivatives by the same amount.  This is because without gradient,  $ \\nabla J(m,b)$, we think of as steering us in the correct direction.  In other words, our derivatives ensure we are making the correct **proportional** changes to $m$ and $b$.  So scaling down these changes to make sure we don't update our regression line too quickly works fine, so long as we keep me moving in the correct direction.  While we're at it, we can also get rid of multiplying our partials by 2.  As mentioned, so long as our changes are proportional we're in good shape. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our second tweak, note that in general the larger the dataset, the larger the sum of our errors would be.  But that doesn't mean our formulas are less accurate, and there deserve larger changes.  It just means that the total error is larger.  But we should really think accuracy as being proportional to the size of our dataset.  We can correct for this effect by dividing the effect of our update by the size of our dataset, $n$.\n",
