It's very important that you don't leave services running when you aren't using them, because you will be charged for that. If you want to make sure that you haven't left anything running, the easiest thing to do is to check the 'Costs Explorer' page inside AWS. You can find this by searching for 'AWS Cost Explorer' in the search bar on the main page for the AWS Console. This service will show you what your usage is for everything that you can be charged for. It's quite intuitive and easy to use, and should make it easy to see if you are accruing charges because you left something running that you didn't realize. If you left something running that you aren't aware of, you'll see it here -- once you've noticed it, just navigate to the service in question and deactivate it. "
